# Portfolio - CMPT 276

This is a version of my portfolio website built for CMPT 276: Introduction to software engineering. It contains my bio, contact information, and projects.

### License Choice

I chose to use the MIT license for its simplicity and permissiveness, as I would be fine with other people using my UI code, as long as I am attributed. As well as this, my project uses Bootstrap which is licensed under MIT, which avoids licensing issues should someone want to use my customized components.

# Tech Stack
